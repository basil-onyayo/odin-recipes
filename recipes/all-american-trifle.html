        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a creamy, fruity, heavenly dessert. A trifle perfect for Fourth of July or a barbecue. I've been told it's like a super-charged strawberry shortcake.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 quart heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) container lemon yogurt</li>
            <li>1 (3.3 ounce) package instant white chocolate pudding mix</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut-flavored rum, or to taste, divided (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) prepared pound cakes, cubed</li>
            <li>2 pints fresh blueberries, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle strawberries with sugar in a bowl; stir to distribute sugar, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Chill a large metal mixing bowl and beaters from an electric mixer.</li>
            <li>Pour cream into the chilled mixing bowl, and add lemon yogurt, pudding mix, and about 1 tablespoon of coconut rum; beat until fluffy with an electric mixer set on medium speed.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of pound cake cubes into the bottom of a glass 10x15-inch baking dish, and sprinkle cubes with remaining tablespoon coconut rum. Cover pound cake with a layer of strawberries; sprinkle blueberries over strawberries. Spread a thick layer of whipped cream over the berries.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers several times, ending with a layer of strawberries sprinkled with blueberries and reserving about 1 cup of whipped cream; top the trifle with dollops of whipped cream to serve. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
        </ol>
